ofxAppGLFWWindowMulti
=====================

- A multiwindow addon for openFrameworks. 
- Does not require modification to ofApp.cpp. 
- Currently supports OF 0.8.1 (master branch) and 0.8.2/0.8.3 ( with 0.8.2 branch https://github.com/ofTheo/ofxAppGLFWWindowMulti/tree/0.8.2 )
- Tested on OS X - should be compatible with Win/Nix. 

Notes:
- For OS X when you add ofxAppGLFWWindowMulti.cpp to your project you will need to set the file type to Objective-C++ you can do this in the right column/pane of Xcode. 
- For OS X you will need to include the Carbon.framework
- For Linux / Windows users having issues with drawing see this thread - http://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/multiple-screens-2014/
